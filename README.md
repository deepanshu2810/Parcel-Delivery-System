# Parcel-Delivery-System
Express Delivery is a parcel delivery system that automates the process of
delivering heavyweight and lightweight parcels, and letters too from person
to person across the country.
The initial consumer must register their IDs in this system, which must
include their name, address, phone number, and city. Customers can place an
order request after completing the registration process, which includes
information such as the weight, kind of parcel, and recipient information. The
price depends on the parcel's weight. The complete delivery process is
managed online for easy interaction with the organization.
When it comes to handling a big number of consumers and orders across
multiple cities, the manual and offline method of delivering goods is a
daunting challenge. Express Delivery investigates the situation and
streamlines the process. Express delivery not only delivers items from one
person to another but also allows customers to track their orders online.
The online platform will assure security and provide a quick and safe
mechanism for sending packages from one location to another. The parcel-ID
will be generated automatically, and the work will be assigned to the
appropriate staff.
